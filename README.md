The solutions of UVa problems

## UVa
[UVa](https://onlinejudge.org/) is an online automated judge for programming problems hosted by University of Valladolid.
Users can submit the solutions in  ANSI C (C89), C++ (C++98), Pascal, Java, C++11 or Python.
And in this repository, I only practice it with C++ and Java.
